# Preventable Deaths Database and Tracker
This repository contains the code and data for running the [Preventable Deaths Tracker](http://preventabledeathstracker.net). 

## Data
The data is collected from the [Courts and Tribunals Judiciary website](https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/). To capture the data, we run a web scraper which is available in the `data` folder. 
We have processed the names of the deceased due to the sensitive nature of the data.  

## Research and dissemination 
We wrote about the data collection method, web scraping, in *Nature* available here: ["How we learnt to stop worrying and love web scraping"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02558-0) and we have published several reports and studies in academic journals using this data, including: 
1. case series of deaths involving [anticoagulants and cardiovascular disease](https://doi.org/10.3399/BJGPO.2021.0150)
